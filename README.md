Project Title: Advanced HR Analytics for Promotion Eligibility Prediction

Overview:
I led a pioneering HR analytics project aimed at revolutionizing the promotion process within a multinational corporation. The project focused on developing predictive models to identify employees eligible for promotions, targeting managerial positions and below across nine diverse verticals.

Challenges:
The existing promotion process was cumbersome, relying heavily on subjective recommendations and post-training evaluations. This not only delayed role transitions but also hindered timely decision-making.

Solutions:
Utilizing advanced machine learning techniques, including CATBOOST and Random Forest classifiers, I spearheaded the development of a model that predicts promotion eligibility based on a myriad of factors like past performance, training effectiveness, and KPI achievements.

Results:

Achieved a remarkable prediction accuracy of 94.32% on complex datasets involving over 50,000 employee records, substantially reducing the time-to-promotion by 30%.
Enhanced the strategic HR decision-making process, influencing the development of more targeted and efficient training programs.
The modelâ€™s robustness and accuracy led to its deployment across various departments, significantly smoothing the transition phase for promoted employees and aligning workforce capabilities with organizational needs.
Technologies Used:
Python, CATBOOST, Random Forest, XGBoost, GridSearchCV, sklearn, Pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, numpy, scipy.

Impact:
This project not only improved the efficiency of the promotion process but also established a data-driven culture within the HR operations, fostering fairness and transparency in employee advancement decisions.
